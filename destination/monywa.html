    	    Like its neighbour Mandalay, a visit to Monywa is not really about the town itself, but a series of interesting attractions in the surrounding countryside. Pronounced in two syllables (mon-ywa), Monywa is an engaging trade town that makes a sensible stopping point when looping north between Bagan and Mandalay. The town itself is big, hot and flat, with relatively little to see beyond the markets and the pleasant Chindwin riverside setting, though two large, central pagoda complexes, Shwezigon Paya and Su Taung Pye Zedi, are well worth a wander. It is also an embarkation point for the adventurous few who boat-hop the Chindwin to little-visited villages to the north.
