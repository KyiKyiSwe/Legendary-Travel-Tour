								Like its neighbour Mandalay, a visit to Monywa is not really about the town itself, but a series of interesting attractions in the surrounding countryside. Pronounced in two syllables (mon-ywa), Monywa is an engaging trade town that makes a sensible stopping point when looping north between Bagan and Mandalay. The town itself is big, hot and flat, with relatively little to see beyond the markets and the pleasant Chindwin riverside setting, though two large, central pagoda complexes, Shwezigon Paya and Su Taung Pye Zedi, are well worth a wander. It is also an embarkation point for the adventurous few who boat-hop the Chindwin to little-visited villages to the north.

								Mon State has a mix of everything that's wonderful and unique about Myanmar: golden temples, a palpable colonial past, charming villages, a mix of different ethnic groups and even some scenic coastline. Travelling in this region is generally easy and the people are friendly, while the distances between key destinations are short. Yet, despite the historic cities and the presence of some of Myanmar's most holy religious sites, relatively few visitors make it down here. That, though, is their loss and travellers who do come have all the more space to enjoy it all.
